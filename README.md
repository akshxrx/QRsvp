### QRsvp allows event coordinators to create QR codes that can allow invitees to do specific things with a scan like entering a venue, connecting to wifi, or entering exclusive events. As we were looking for ideas, we realized that creating invitations for events was always tedious. QR codes were always very versatile and easy to use. With this, we hope to make a tedious task more convenient!
